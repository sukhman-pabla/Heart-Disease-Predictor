## Novelty

- Heart disease is one of the most significant problem that is arising in the world today. Cardiovascular disease prediction is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. Machine learning (ML) has been showing an effective assistance in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industries and hospitals.
- Chronic Disease Prediction plays a pivotal role in healthcare informatics. It is crucial to diagnose the disease at an early stage.
- User can search for doctorâ€™s help at any point of time and talk about their Heart Disease and get instant diagnosis.
